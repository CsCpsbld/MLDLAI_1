An intelligent child, Turing spent much of his early life fostered in various English homes with his elder brother John—Julius and Ethel lived in India while Julius worked in the Indian Civil Service—and was often a lonely child. As biographer Andrew Hodges put it, Turing’s life was one of “an isolated and autonomous mind.” [...] Turing was fascinated with science, but he found little encouragement to pursue his interests from his foster homes or even his mother, who was fearful he would not be accepted into English public school. At 13 years old, however, he was accepted into a boarding school called Sherborne School, where he studied advanced scientific concepts like relativity on his own.\", \"score\": 0.90849644}, {\"title\": \"Alan Turing (1912 - 1954) - Biography - University of St Andrews\", \"url\": \"https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Turing/\", \"content\": \"Alan Turing was born at Paddington, London.
